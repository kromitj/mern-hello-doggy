to upload a new video/pic all users who are subribed to them should be notified with an update notification

###Adoptions

Website needs a module/page where users can see all adoptions make during a current week and be able to upvote the one they have the most feels for
	> Each adoption needs to have a repeatable module with video/picures, where the everyday user can most efficiently gain a overview of the experiece of the doggie at X-company and vote for the one that they feel deserve the adoption of the week
